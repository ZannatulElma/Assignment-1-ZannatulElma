                <p>Choose a community you’d like to help for a period of twelve months. View the list of sponsored
                    communities at Family-to-Family.org. Complete your online donation. All it takes is a minimum
                    monthly credit or debit card donation of about $30 that will pay for five to seven meals worth of
                    groceries for the sponsor family every month.</p>

                <p>Shelters and organizations (like us) always welcome donations of cash, groceries, and clothes, but
                    there are ways to customize what you give. First, ask the shelter what they need most. Second,
                    consider the time of year, and donate summer clothes in the warmer months, or winter clothes when
                    it’s cold. Think about donating toiletries or personal products,</p>

                <p>The project is to improve the educational status of poor children. The specific objectives of the
                    project are to initiate the community to advocate for support and education of poor children, to
                    increase the enrollment of students in school, to increase the access of poor children to education,
                    to change the life condition of poor children through education and to empower the households of
